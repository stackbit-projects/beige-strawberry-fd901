# Compose your Docs with __Ease__.

Compose is a lean theme for the `Hugo`, inspired by [forestry.io](https://forestry.io). 

We do a [Pull Request](https://github.com/onweru/compose/pulls) contributions workflow on **GitHub**. Also feel free to raise any issues or feature suggestions.

{{< tip "warning" >}}
Note that the theme is built with simplicity in mind. [This way](/), if a suggestion complicates the usability of the theme, it may be declined. New users are always welcome!
{{< /tip >}}

{{< tip >}}
You can [generate graphs, charts](]("docs/compose/graphs-charts-tables/#show-a-pie-doughnut--bar-chart-at-once")) and tables from a csv, ~~or a json~~ dataset
